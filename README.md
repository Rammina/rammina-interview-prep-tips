## Interview Retrospective: Actionable Tasks

### 1. Prepare and memorize a strong intro (HIGH PRIORITY)



* Write a **1.5–2 minute "Tell me about yourself" intro**
* Memorize it word-for-word so you can deliver it anytime

**Include:**

* What you are doing now: current role and projects
* How you built your skills: learning path and key experiences
* What you are working toward: and how it relates to the role

**Practice:**

* Say it out loud daily until automatic
* Practice even when you do not think they will ask: they most likely will

(No prepared intro will make you seem like a very weak or unprepared candidate)

### 2. Study common interview-style questions (pattern exposure)



* Search online and study:

  * Common JavaScript interview questions
  * Common React interview questions
  * Common Node.js interview questions
  * Common MongoDB interview questions (or other relevant DB like MySQL/postgreSQL)
  * Common Express.js interview questions
  * Common web dev or situational interview questions
  * Common interview questions especially for tools you added on your resume

 * Note: You should be familiar with concepts in the technologies and skills you put on your resume, and can answer them both verbally and in code.

**How:**

* Aim for **30–50+ Q and A per topic**
* Focus on:

  * explaining concepts verbally
  * recognizing question patterns
* Do not just memorize answers: make sure to understand why they are correct

### 3. Solidify core JavaScript fundamentals


Review and deeply understand:

* Type coercion: for example `"1" + 2 + 3` vs `1 + 2 + "3"`
* Event delegation: what it is, why it is used, simple example
* DOM events and bubbling
* Basic language gotchas commonly used in interviews as a knowledge check.

* Your goal is to be able to explain these concepts simply, out loud. Be able to convey them in both verbal and code form.

### 4. Prepare concise explanations for your projects


For each project, prepare:

* 1–2 sentence summary
* Tech stack used
* What you personally worked on
* What you learned from it

**Specifically prepare (for example, these projects you worked on in Rammina Dev & Design):**

* Restofund:

  * Brownfield project
  * Maintenance-focused
  * Alpha phase had approximately 15–20 blind users

* Instagram Analyzer:

  * Beta phase
  * Approximately 20 blind users or testers

* Say that other people were in charge of distributing it to users and managing the testing of the app. You just helped develop it, and you were not given much more information by your manager about other aspects of the app's development.

---

### 5. Handle user count and metrics questions professionally



* Prepare honest, short answers for:

  * number of users
  * project maturity: alpha, beta, maintenance
* Say what you know and stop
* Do not speculate or over-explain

---

### 6. Practice explaining experience without blanking



* Rehearse answering:

  * "What are you working on right now?"
  * "What have you done recently?"
* Always have **at least one current project or task ready**

* Avoid saying "I'm not doing anything at the moment. That is a red flag. Always present yourself as someone who is busy doing something."

---

### 7. Learn interview etiquette and signaling



* Never say you can start immediately
* Default answer should be: "I have about a month’s notice"
* Understand this is normal and not suspicious

---

### 8. Expect and accept being cut off



* Mentally rehearse being interrupted
* If cut off:

  * stop
  * do not apologize
  * do not assume you did something wrong

* Reminder: Interviewers often interrupt once they have heard enough, it doesn't mean you did something wrong or did badly on a question.

---

### 9. Normalize not knowing everything



* Accept that:

  * missing trivia does not equal failing the interview
  * interviews are partial signal, not full evaluation

**Focus on:**

* demonstrating reasoning
* communicating clearly
* solving problems when given them

---

### 10. Post-interview reflection (do this every time you finish an interview)


After each interview, write down or at least think about:

* Questions you could not answer
* Concepts you felt shaky on
* What went well: at least one thing

**Then:**

* Turn each weak point into a study item
* Treat interviews as feedback loops for improvement next time.

* Note: This works best if you have someone to discuss it with.
